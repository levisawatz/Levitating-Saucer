This was a fun and challenging project done as part of the U of C ENEL400 design course. Awarded "favorite project" by my professor. It involved many interesting technical aspects of electrical engineering including:
- Analog circuit design
- PID control 
- PCB design
- Electromagnetics
    - Magnetic levitation
    - Wireless power transfer
- Power electronics
- Microcontroller programming

## Levitation PID control circuit:  
More specifically, a "PD" controll system that that uses a Proportonal and Derivative control to keep the levitating saucer in one place and dampen oscillations.  
This circuit uses voltage adders/subtractors/multipliers to reactively compute the power to be sent to the electromagnet that suspends the levitating object.
