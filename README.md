This was a fun and challenging project done as part of the U of C ENEL400 design course. Awarded "favorite project" by my professor. It involved many interesting technical aspects of electrical engineering including:
- Analog circuit design
- PID control 
- PCB design
- Electromagnetics
    - Magnetic levitation
    - Wireless power transfer
- Power electronics
- Microcontroller programming
